# Introduction of intended use for code:
# Our code analyses the League of Legends dataset and tries to answer our research question:
# Can a playerâ€™s focused game mechanic predict the total damage they deal during a match?

# File structure and use of each file:
# After running the "project_group99.ipynb" file, there should be 6 files:
# 1. league_dsproject.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook containing all the code)
# 2. acc_vs_kval.jpg (.jpg file containing a visualisation of accuracy vs k-value)
# 3. cm_dt.jpg (.jpg file containing the confusion matrix for decision tree)
# 4. cm_knn.jpg (.jpg file containing the confusion matrix for KNN model)
# 5. dt.pdf (.pdf file containing the decision tree model)
# 6. final_report.pdf (.pdf file containing the final report of the experiment)


# Instructions on how to run your code:
# Open the Jupyter Notebook file called "project_group99.ipynb"
# Click "Run all" in the toolbar

# Additional Notes:
# Please refer to the "dt.pdf" file for a better view of the decision tree output
